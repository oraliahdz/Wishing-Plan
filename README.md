# Development

## Getting started

### Pre-requisites

- Use node version "^12.19.0 || ^14.15.0 || ^16.13.0 || ^18.12.0"
  - This is because of the compatibility of next-auth@4.17.0
- Install yarn globally `npm install -g yarn`
- Insdall Docker e.g., Docker Desktop for Windows or Docker Engine for Linux. See [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for more information.
  - This is to have a local database for development.

#### Windows

- Install win-node-env globally `npm install -g win-node-env` to be able to run e.g., `yarn db-seed` on Windows.

### Installation and setup

- Clone the repository
- Create local .env `cp .env.example .env` and fill in the values
- Install dependencies `yarn install` or just `yarn`
- Start the database `docker-compose up -d`
- Run `yarn db-push` to migrate the database
- Run `yarn db-seed` to seed the database with test data
- Run the development server `yarn dev`

## [Project Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/wishing-plan-637b3ad68b9646001dfac86a/board)

**IMPORTANT**: In order to see our project board on ZenHub, you need to have an account and have connected it with your GitHub account.

For development management we are using [ZenHub Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/wishing-plan-637b3ad68b9646001dfac86a/board). It is recommended to install the browser [extension for ZenHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd?hl=en), to be able to view information from our ZenHub board within GitHub.

**NOTE:** ZenHub is not required however, as the issues we are working on are shared between GitHub and ZenHub.
